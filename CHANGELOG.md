## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Basic keyboard navigation in the UAV list view.

- The UAV list view now shows both the UAV ID and the mission (show) specific ID
  of the UAV all the time.

- The "flash lights" operation has been bound to the `W` hotkey for the selected
  drone.

- Added indicators in the header for showing the accuracy of the RTK survey
  (when reported by the base station) and the number of satellites for which
  RTK correction data is sent to the drones.

- Added a battery status indicator to the header that shows the average and the
  minimum battery voltage of the set of tracked drones.

### Changed
